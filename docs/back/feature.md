# Feature in Time series

## Introduction
I learned a lot from the data competition especially Kaggle about feature engineering in time series. They are so good and creative at it.


## Auto-regression: period
- lagged history feature
- rolling window statistical feature, like last week, last last week, last month, like mean, median, max, std, skew, quantile
- increase/decrease/diff feature, like month-on-month ratio, year-on-year ratioï¼Œ diff
- moving average

## Statistical feature

- categorical feature can also combined with auto-regression feature
- and percentage feature

## Other feature
- other model's predict as a feature
- auto correlation, partial auto correlation
