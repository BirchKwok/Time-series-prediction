# RNN

## Introduction
RNN and its modification LSTM, GRU are good at modeling the sequence data. So it's natural to use them in time series application. And they tend to do better on volatile data.


## Performance


## How to use it

- teacher forced training is not always the best. In prediction, the accumulated error maybe become larger and larger, especially for large shake data.
- Scheduled sampling
